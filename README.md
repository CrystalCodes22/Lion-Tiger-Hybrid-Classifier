# Lion-Tiger-Hybrid-Classifier
This AI project classifies between Ligers and Tigons. Both Ligers and Tigons are Lion-Tiger hybrids, but a Liger is born when a male Lion and a female Tiger breed, while a Tigon is born when a female Lion and a male Tiger breed. When given the photo of either a Liger or Tigon, my AI can distinguish between the two.
